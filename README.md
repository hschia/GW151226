# GW151226_samples
Posterior samples for the GW151226 binary black hole event described in [arxiv:2105.06486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06486): "Signs of higher multipoles and orbital precession in GW151226".

The default parameter estimation samples are found in ```GW151226_IASprior.pkl```, whereby the effects of orbital precession and higher order radiative multipoles are included in the likelihood evaluation in the ```IMRPhenomXPHM``` waveform model [(https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06503)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06503). In these cases, the spin prior is uniform in $`\chi_{\rm eff}`$.
