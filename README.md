# GW151226_samples
Posterior samples for the GW151226 binary black hole event described in arxiv:2105.06486: "Signs of higher multipoles and orbital precession in GW151226".

The default parameter estimation samples are found in ```GW151226_IASprior.pkl```, whereby the likelihood is evaluated using ```IMRPhenomXPHM```, a waveform model which includes the effects of orbital precession and higher radiative multipoles. In this case, the uniform-in-$$\chi_{\rm eff}$$ prior is used for the spin measurements.
